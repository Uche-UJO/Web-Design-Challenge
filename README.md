## Web-Design-Challenge

### Problem

######  Analyze the weather of more than 500 cities to investigate how weather changes with latitude.


### Process

###### Design a web visualization dashboard displaying weather characteristics (maximum temperature, humidity, cloudiness and wind speeds) of these 500+ cities. 
###### In designing this dashboard, create individual pages for each plot and a means by which we can navigate between them. These pages will contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations.
